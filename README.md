# hello-world
My VERY FIRST REPOSITORY!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hey, how's it going?
That's good/bad, I'm glad/sorry. That really rocks/sucks. I wish I knew what the fuck you're saying so I don't have to keep putting two answers for every possible answer. So, what's new? Oh, really? Wow, um, that's... wow. I don't even know how to respond to that. FUCK. Was not expecting that... god damn dude, that's... just... holy shit. SO HOW 'BOUT THAT THING ONE THAT SPORTS TEAM DID, HUH? That was pretty fucking crazy right? I know, it is pretty good/bad weather we're having, isn't it? Welp, I gotta goooooo.... I got this thing with the ducks and the waffles and the balloons, it's all pretty complicated and Thomas doesn't know what the hell he's doing, Jerry's not very good at explaing things, and Eustace can't operate a forklift to save his life sooooooo yeah... I gotta go. Good luck with that, uh, thing. Later.
